# Breast Cancer Prediction Model with Decision Tree Classification

## Introduction

This repository contains a machine learning model for breast cancer prediction using Decision Tree Classification. Decision Trees are powerful and interpretable models widely used for classification tasks. In this project, we will leverage the scikit-learn library and a breast cancer dataset to build and evaluate a Decision Tree Classification model for predicting breast cancer.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset, which is included in the scikit-learn library. This dataset consists of 569 instances and 30 features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. The target variable is binary, indicating whether the tumor is malignant (1) or benign (0).

## Installation

Before running the code, make sure you have Python and the following libraries installed:

- scikit-learn
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/breast-cancer-prediction.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd breast-cancer-prediction
   ```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. Open the `Breast_Cancer_Prediction.ipynb` notebook in your browser and follow the instructions to train and evaluate the Decision Tree Classification model.

## Model Building

In the Jupyter Notebook, you will find the following sections:

- Data Preprocessing: Data loading, exploration, and preprocessing.
- Model Training: Building and training the Decision Tree Classification model.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model's performance using various metrics.
- Conclusion: Summarizing the results and insights.

You can modify the notebook to experiment with different hyperparameters, feature engineering, or visualization techniques.

## Results

The model's performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, will be displayed in the notebook. Additionally, you can visualize the Decision Tree for interpretability.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the process of building a breast cancer prediction model using Decision Tree Classification with scikit-learn. Decision Trees offer transparency and can be useful in medical diagnostics. Feel free to use and modify this code for your own projects or research.
